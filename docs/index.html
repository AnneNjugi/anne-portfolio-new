  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Anne Njugi, a mental health practitioner based in Nairobi, Kenya. I have a passion for understanding people, telling meaningful stories, and building things that make life better. My academic roots are in Criminology and Counseling Psychology, but my work extends beyound the therapy room.</p> 
    <p>I've facilitated group sessions in under-resourced communities, supported teens through difficult transitions, and worked with adults navigating complex emotions and trauma.</p>
    <p>What drives me most is the human experiences of healing, growth, and relating to one another. I'm specifically interested in African approaches to mental health, navigating the impact of trauma on women, and how to make therapy more accessible and relevant to marginalized groups.</p>
    <p>Outside of psychology, I'm endlessly curious. I've explored tech tools for investigative work, drafted business plans for security startups, and written children's stories and mental health content that blend creativity with purpose.</p>
    <p>I enjoy learning new skills such as scripting, experimenting with architectural design tools, and researching. 
    <p>I'm someone who listens closely, thinks critically, and acts intentionaly. I bring warmth, structure and fresh ideas to every space I step in, and I'm always open to new collaborations.</p>
